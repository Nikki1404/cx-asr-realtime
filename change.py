For latency i am thinking of sending audios of increasing length.. 1 seconds, 2 seconds and so on upto 20 seconds maybe 
For pauses it will be tricky... Maybe we can synthesise audios with custom pauses
One more important thing.  We expect to receive speech in realtime mostly via mic. So let's try to use reference audios which is as close to mic as possible (w.r.t. sample rate, file formats etc )
