applied normalization only to remove formatting and representation differences that unfairly increase WER. This includes lowercasing, removing punctuation, expanding abbreviations (e.g., “Mr.” → “mister”), expanding contractions (“don’t” → “do not”), and normalizing numbers (“21st” → “twenty first”, “$10” → “ten dollars”, “10%” → “ten percent”). These changes preserve meaning while reducing variation across ASR outputs. However, we did not normalize true recognition errors such as word substitutions, morphological changes (e.g., “mannerless” vs “manner less”), or grammar differences, since those reflect actual model performance and should be counted in WER.
