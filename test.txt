WER Performance on Benchmark Dataset

Evaluated using Librispeech samples (aligned with HF leaderboard dataset).

Competitive or improved WER compared to Whisper in streaming mode.

More stable incremental hypothesis refinement.
Cleaner WebSocket-Based Streaming Integration
The model integrates cleanly into a WebSocket streaming server architecture where audio frames are pushed incrementally and transcripts are streamed back as JSON events. This matched well with our async event loop architecture and did not require custom patching.

Improved Parallelism Scaling vs Re-buffering Models
Because it does not re-encode historical audio on every chunk, scaling concurrency did not result in exponential compute overhead. This is a major production advantage for real-time IVR or multi-agent deployments.

Native Support for Punctuation & Capitalization
The streaming outputs include well-formed text without requiring a separate punctuation restoration model, reducing post-processing latency in the real-time pipeline.

More Predictable Latency Curve
When measuring latency across different chunk sizes, we observed smoother scaling behavior compared to models that rely on fixed window inference. This gives more flexibility in tuning chunk size for optimal latency vs accuracy tradeoff.

Production-Friendly Architecture
Compared to Parakeet (which required an additional exposed service), Nemotron Streaming was easier to containerize within our existing inference stack and did not require additional service orchestration.
